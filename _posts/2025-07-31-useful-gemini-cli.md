## Overview

> Welcome to this guide on useful configuration tips for the Gemini CLI! In this post, we'll explore how to customize your Gemini CLI experience to boost your productivity.

## Global Configuration: `gemini.md`

The Gemini CLI uses a configuration file named `gemini.md` to manage global settings. This file allows you to define preferences that apply across all your projects.

### Location

The global configuration file is located at `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`.

### Example: Assisting with English Phrasing

You can add rules to help with your workflow. For example, you can add a rule to get assistance with English phrasing.

```markdown
# GEMINI.md - Global User Preferences

## Interaction Guideline: English Phrasing Assistance

**Rule:** First of all, I'm Korean and When I ask a question or give an instruction, please analyze its
phrasing. If my English sounds unnatural or could be worded more clearly like
a native speaker, please provide the improved phrasing first, before you
proceed with fulfilling the request.
```

## Custom Commands

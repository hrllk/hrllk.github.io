### prerquirements


### overview
> **subnet** (short for "subnetwork") is a logical division of an IP address space. <br>
It allows you to split a larger IP range into smaller, more manageable networks.<br>

IP주소를 논리적으로 나눈 공간<br>
많은 IP대역을 작게 분할해 여러 네트워크로 나누기 관리하기 위함<br>



### benefits


1. **better network**:
    - 네트워크를 보다 세밀하게 제어할 수 있음
    - 낭비를 방지할 수 있음

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Reduces broadcast domains (broadcast messages are only sent within the subnet)
   - Can improve overall network performance

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Easier to implement firewalls and security policies at the subnet level
   - Can isolate sensitive networks from others

4. **Scalability**:
   - Subnets can be sized according to specific needs (e.g., small office vs large data center)


### disadvantages
1. **overhead**:
    사용할 수 있는 IP갯수가 줄어듦 (나눠)

사용할 수 있는 IP갯수가 줄어듦 (나눠진 서브넷 속에서 네트워크 주소, 브로드캐스팅에 대한 대역은 쓸 수 없으므로)
    - subnetting을 하면 할수록(네트워크를 나눌수록)



### How It Works

For example, using a `/24` subnet mask:

``` .conf
Network:     192.168.1.0/24
Broadcast:   192.168.1.255
Usable IPs:  192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254 (254 usable hosts)
```

### Config Example

Here's a typical subnet configuration:

``` .conf
# Router interface IP
interface GigabitEthernet0/1:
    ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

# Hosts on this subnet would have IPs like:
HostA: 192.168.1.2
HostB: 192.168.1.3
```

### Characteristics

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Subnets can be further divided into smaller subnets if needed
- **Broadcast Domain**: All devices in a subnet are part of the same broadcast domain
- **Network Address**: The first IP in the range is typically used as the network address

### Use Cases

1. Small Businesses:
   - Perfect for offices with 25-50 devices
   - Easy to manage and secure

2. Large Enterprises:
   - Can create multiple subnets for different departments or locations
   - Improved security through subnet segmentation

3. Data Centers:
   - Critical for organizing server farms
   - Allows for precise traffic control between services

### Conclusion

Subnetting is essential for any network of reasonable size, as it provides better organization, performance, and security compared to using a single large flat network.

### nmap 이란?
> Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful and widely used open-source network scanning and reconnaissance tool. It is designed to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus providing valuable information about network infrastructure and security.

nmap == 오픈소스 툴<br>
to 네트워크를 스캔하기위한 툴<br>
의미있는 정보를 제공 (네트워크 인프라와 관련되거나 보안과 관련된 정보)<br>

> Nmap falls into the category of "network scanning tools" or "network exploration tools." These tools are used to probe and analyze network systems, identify open ports, detect vulnerabilities, and map the network topology. Nmap, in particular, is highly versatile and offers a range of features for network discovery, port scanning, service/version detection, OS fingerprinting, and more.

<!--
Host discovery: Nmap can determine which hosts are active and reachable on a network.
Port scanning: Nmap can scan a target host or a range of IP addresses to identify open ports and the services associated with those ports.
Service/version detection: Nmap can detect the services and their versions running on the target hosts.
OS fingerprinting: Nmap can attempt to determine the operating system running on a target host by analyzing network responses.
Scripting and automation: Nmap supports scripting capabilities (using the Nmap Scripting Engine) to automate tasks and perform more advanced network scans.
Security auditing: Nmap can be used to assess the security of a network by identifying potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
By using Nmap, network administrators, security professionals, and penetration testers can gather essential information about network devices, identify potential security risks, and assess the overall security posture of a network.

In your post, you can categorize Nmap under "Network Security Tools," "Network Scanning Tools," or "Network Exploration Tools" to highlight its purpose and use in the field of network security and reconnaissance.
